Ubuntu (Native Environment): When running on a native Linux environment, bash and other related utilities are running directly on the operating system, making full use of the system's resources without any additional overhead.

Git Bash on Windows (Emulation): Git Bash provides a minimal set of Unix-like tools on Windows. However, it runs within a Windows environment, which introduces a layer of emulation or compatibility. This adds overhead and can significantly impact performance.

Linux Filesystem: Linux filesystems (like ext4, XFS, etc.) are optimized for Unix-like operations. They handle file I/O operations very efficiently, especially for tasks common in shell scripts like file creation, deletion, and modification.

Windows Filesystem (NTFS): When running Git Bash, the scripts interact with the Windows NTFS filesystem, which is not optimized for Unix-like operations. This can slow down file I/O operations.

Linux Network Stack: Linux has a very efficient and optimized network stack, which can be a significant factor if your script makes network calls.
Git Bash Compatibility Layer: Git Bash uses tools like MSYS2 or Cygwin to provide Unix-like functionality on Windows. These tools introduce a compatibility layer that translates Unix system calls to Windows system calls. This translation adds overhead and can slow down script execution.
Linux I/O Performance: Direct access to hardware and efficient I/O buffering in Linux contributes to faster execution of scripts involving heavy I/O operations.

Windows I/O Performance in Git Bash: The I/O performance in Git Bash can be slower due to the additional layers of abstraction and the differences in how Windows handles I/O operations.
